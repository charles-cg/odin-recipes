    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The following recipe shows how to make this quick and easy mexican craving</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups dough flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups of warm water</li>
        <li>1 quarter of frying oil</li>
        <li>Fried beans</li>
        <li>Various toppings (onions, cabbage, cheese, chorizo, steak)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk masa harina and salt together in a bowl. Stir in enough water until dough is smooth and holds together. </li>
        <li>Form dough into twelve 2-inch balls. Place balls onto parchment paper and flatten to 1/2-inch thick circles. </li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Working in batches, fry a few sopes at a time until lightly browned, about 30 seconds per side. Transfer with tongs to a paper towel-lined plate and let cool just until they can be handled, 2 to 3 minutes. Pinch the edges of each sope together to form a little boat. </li>
        <li>Return sopes to the hot oil and fry until golden and cooked through, 1 to 2 more minutes. Drain on paper towels. </li>
        <li>Spread the beans on the sopes</li>
        <li>Add Toppings like cabbage, chorizo, steak, etc.</li>
